Overview

The Brochure Generator is a Python-based tool designed to automatically create synthetic brochures for use in machine learning tasks. 
It generates high-quality brochures with customizable text, colors, layouts, and dynamically generated tables. This tool is primarily intended for creating synthetic training data for document classification and computer vision projects.

To generate brochures, simply set the number of desired brochures by assigning a value to the INSTANCES variable in the main.py script, and run the project using:
python main.py

All necessary materials for generation, such as sample images, fonts, and text, are provided in the samples directory. You can also add your own assets to further customize the generated brochures.

The resulting dataset will be saved in the dataset folder.
